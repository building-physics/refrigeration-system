# Building Refrigeration System 
## **About**

The existing refrigeration system for OpenStudio was originally designed for a prototype supermarket model. To support the development of new modular space types, it is crucial to refactor the system. This process includes refining the design by utilizing the manufacturer's existing data, along with incorporating the latest data from manufacturers, to enhance the systemâ€™s adaptability and functionality. This repository contatins only refrigeration system database for now. **This is a work in progress**
