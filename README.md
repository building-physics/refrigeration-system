**Background**

The existing refrigeration system was originally designed for a prototype supermarket model. To support the development of new modular space types, it is crucial to refactor the system. This process includes refining the design by utilizing the manufacturer's existing data, along with incorporating the latest data from manufacturers, to enhance the systemâ€™s adaptability and functionality.
